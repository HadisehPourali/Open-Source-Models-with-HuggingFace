# Open Source Models with Hugging Face

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the use of various open-source models available through the Hugging Face library for a range of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision tasks.

## Contents

The notebook covers the following tasks:

1. Conversation Task
2. Translation
3. Summarization
4. Sentence Embedding or Sentence Similarity
5. Image Captioning
6. Visual Question & Answering
7. Zero Shot Classification

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- PyTorch
- Other dependencies (specified in the notebook)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `Open_Source_Models_with_HuggingFace_v2.ipynb` file.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the cells in order to see demonstrations of each task.

## Task Descriptions

### 1. Conversation Task
Demonstrates how to use a conversational AI model to generate responses in a dialogue context.

### 2. Translation
Shows how to translate text from one language to another using pre-trained translation models.

### 3. Summarization
Illustrates the use of models to create concise summaries of longer texts.

### 4. Sentence Embedding or Sentence Similarity
Explains how to generate sentence embeddings and compute similarity between sentences.

### 5. Image Captioning
Demonstrates the generation of textual descriptions for input images.

### 6. Visual Question & Answering
Shows how to use models that can answer questions about images.

### 7. Zero Shot Classification
Illustrates the use of models for classifying text into arbitrary categories without specific training.

## Note

This notebook is intended for educational and demonstration purposes. The models used may require significant computational resources, especially for tasks involving large language models or image processing.
